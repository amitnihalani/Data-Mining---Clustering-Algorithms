Before running the project, make sure the following things are taken care of:
1. All the input files(for example: cho.txt and  iyer.txt files) should be inside the 'src' folder.
2. Inside the 'src' folder, there will be another folder py. All the algorithms generate a result/output file in this folder. 
   It also contains the Python script (PCA.py) that takes these results as input and generates the PCA output.
   There is also a visualiasation.py script that will be used to generate the dendogram output using the input generated by the HAC algorithm implemented in java.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: To Run the python scripts we need the libraries: Matplotlib, SKLearns, NumPy

To Run the project, run the main.java file.
- The console will ask the user to enter all the needed information required to run the project.
